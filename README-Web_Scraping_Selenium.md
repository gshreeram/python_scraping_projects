# Website Data Scraping and Analysis using Selenium

This repository contains Python scripts for web scraping using Selenium, a popular web automation tool. The scripts are designed to scrape specific data from different websites: adamchoi.co.uk for football match data, Audible for product data, and Twitter for tweets data.

## Project Overview

Web scraping refers to the process of automatically extracting data from websites. It can be a powerful technique for gathering information, performing market research, and generating insights from online sources. In this project, we use Python and Selenium to automate web scraping tasks and retrieve data from various websites.

The scraped data will be saved in an Excel file for further analysis. The script provides a flexible and customizable approach to extract the desired information, allowing users to adapt it to their specific requirements.

## Goals

The main goals of this project are as follows:

Scrape Football Match Data: The script football_match_data_scraper.py allows you to scrape football match data from adamchoi.co.uk. It navigates to the website, selects the desired league, and retrieves match information such as date, teams, and scores. The scraped data is saved in a CSV file.

Scrape Audible Product Data: The script audible_product_data_scraper.py enables you to scrape product data from Audible. It searches for a specific product, retrieves information such as title, author, rating, and price, and saves the data in a CSV file.

Scrape Twitter Tweets Data: The script twitter_tweets_data_scraper.py allows you to scrape tweets from Twitter. It searches for tweets based on a specified query, retrieves information such as the username, tweet text, and timestamp, and saves the data in a CSV file.

- [x] Scrape the  website to gather data.
- [x] Utilize the `Selenium` library to scrape data.
- [] Perform data preparation tasks, such as cleaning, transforming, and structuring the collected information.
- [] Analyze the data to gain insights, identify patterns, or generate meaningful visualizations.
- [] Enable users to customize the script to scrape additional data fields or adapt it to different music websites.
- [] Foster collaboration and encourage contributions from the open-source community to enhance the scraping and analysis capabilities.
