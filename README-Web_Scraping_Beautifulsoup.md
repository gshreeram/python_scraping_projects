# Music Website Data Scraping and Analysis using openpyxl

This repository provides a Python script that utilizes the `openpyxl` library to scrape a music website and perform data preparation and analysis.

## Project Overview

The project aims to gather data from a music website and leverage the power of Python and `openpyxl` to prepare and analyze the collected information. By scraping the website, we can extract valuable data about artists, albums, songs, and other relevant details.

The scraped data will be saved in an Excel file for further analysis. The script provides a flexible and customizable approach to extract the desired information, allowing users to adapt it to their specific requirements.

## Goals

- [x] Scrape the music website to gather data on artists, albums, songs, and other relevant details.
- [x] Utilize the `openpyxl` library to store the scraped data in an Excel file.
- [] Perform data preparation tasks, such as cleaning, transforming, and structuring the collected information.
- [] Analyze the data to gain insights, identify patterns, or generate meaningful visualizations.
- [] Enable users to customize the script to scrape additional data fields or adapt it to different music websites.
- [] Foster collaboration and encourage contributions from the open-source community to enhance the scraping and analysis capabilities.
