# Website Data Scraping and Analysis using Scrapy

This repository contains Python scripts for web scraping using Scrapy, a powerful and flexible web scraping framework. The scripts are designed to scrape specific data from different websites: Worldometers for population data, Audible for product data, and Subslikescript for movie data. The script also scraps API: Quotes

## Project Overview

WWeb scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. It allows us to gather valuable information, perform data analysis, and generate insights. In this project, we use Python and Scrapy to automate web scraping tasks and retrieve data from various websites.

The scraped data will be saved in an Excel or json file for further analysis. The script provides a flexible and customizable approach to extract the desired information, allowing users to adapt it to their specific requirements.

## Goals

The main goals of this project are as follows:

Scrape World Population Data (`Scrapy Spider`): The script worldometers.py allows you to scrape population data from Worldometers. It navigates to the website, retrieves population information for different countries, and saves the data in a structured format (e.g., CSV or JSON).

Scrape Audible Product Data (`Scrapy Spider`): The script audible.py enables you to scrape product data from Audible. It searches for specific products, retrieves information such as title, author, rating, and price, and saves the data in a structured format (e.g., CSV or JSON or MongoDb or SQL Lite 3).

Scrape Subslikescript Movie Data (`Scrapy Crawler`): The script subslikescript.py allows you to scrape movie data from Subslikescript. It searches for movies, retrieves information such as title, genre, rating, and synopsis, and saves the data in a structured format (e.g., CSV or JSON).

Scrape Quotes Data (`Scrapy API`): The script quotes.py, quotes_login.py allows you to scrape quotes data from Quotes.toscrape.com. It connects to the Quotes API and retrieves information such as author, tags and quotes and saves the data in a structured format (e.g., CSV or JSON).

Scrape Football Match Data (`Scrapy Spider Splash`): The script adamchoi.py allows you to scrape football match data from adamchoi.co.uk. It navigates to the website, selects the desired league, and retrieves match information such as date, teams, and scores. The scraped data is saved in a CSV file.
