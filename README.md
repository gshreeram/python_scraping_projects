# Project Overview and Goals

This project involves the development of web, data, or PDF scraping applications using Python. The primary objective is to extract and analyze information from various online sources or files automatically. The project aims to leverage Python's robust libraries and frameworks for efficient and reliable data extraction.

## Project Scope

The project scope includes the following:

- [x] **Web Scraping**: Develop Python scripts to extract data from websites using libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium. The extracted data can include text, images, tables, or any other relevant information.

    1. [Web Scraping - Beautifulsoup](README-Web_Scraping_Beautifulsoup.md)
    2. [Web Scraping - Selenium](README-Web_Scraping_Selenium.md)
    3. [Web Scraping - Scrapy](README-Web_Scraping_Scrapy.md)

- [x] **Data Scraping**: Create scripts to scrape data from online databases, APIs, or other data sources. This may involve interacting with APIs, parsing JSON or XML responses, or accessing data through web services.

- [ ] **PDF Scraping**: Develop Python code to extract data from PDF documents. This can include extracting text, tables, images, or any other relevant information present in the PDF files.

## Goals

The primary goals of this project are as follows:

- [x] **Data Extraction**: Create robust and efficient scripts to extract data from the specified sources accurately. The goal is to retrieve the required information while ensuring data integrity and reliability.

- [x] **Data Cleaning and Processing**: Implement data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to ensure the extracted data is in a structured format suitable for further analysis. This may include removing duplicates, handling missing values, or normalizing data.

- [ ] **Automation**: Design the scraping applications to run autonomously or on a schedule, allowing for regular updates of the extracted data. This reduces the manual effort required for data extraction and ensures up-to-date information.

- [x] **Error Handling and Logging**: Implement error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions during scraping, ensuring the application continues to run smoothly. Additionally, include logging functionality to track the progress and identify any potential issues.

- [ ] **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Leverage the extracted data to perform analysis and generate insights or visualizations. This may involve using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, or Matplotlib to gain meaningful insights from the collected data.

- [ ] **Maintainability and Scalability**: Develop a well-structured and modular codebase that is easy to maintain and extend. Consider scalability aspects to handle larger datasets or additional data sources in the future.
